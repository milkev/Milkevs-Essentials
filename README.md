# <center>Behold, my stuff

### Milkevs Essentials and Forge!
Playing on Forge but want to use Milkev's Essentials? Look no further than [Sinytra](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sinytra-connector)! Milkevs Essentials has full compatability with Sinytra for playing on Forge & Neoforge.

### Future plans
In the future this should come to have a fair bit more content! I've got lots of plans, though I don't know how to program most of them, so it will be a lot of learning for me.

### Config Galore!
All (future and present) blocks, items, tools and mechanics have configs to individually enable / disable them, as well as change their values. Recipes are easily changable with datapacks! The default recipes are balanced around vanilla progression, with things like the Flight Charm requiring nether stars and elytra!
