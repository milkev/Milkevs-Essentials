# <center>Behold, my stuff

### Milkevs Essentials and Neoforge!
Playing on Neoforge but want to use Milkev's Essentials? Look no further than [Sinytra](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sinytra-connector)! Milkevs Essentials has full compatability with Sinytra for playing on Forge (1.20.1) & Neoforge (1.21.1).

### Config Galore!
All (future and present) blocks, items, tools and mechanics have configs to individually enable / disable them, as well as change their values. Recipes are easily changable with datapacks! The default recipes are balanced around vanilla progression, with things like the Flight Charm requiring nether stars and elytra!

### Issues?
You can either report them to [Github](https://github.com/milkev/Milkevs-Essentials/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) or my [Discord](https://discord.gg/DjXjs5Ev8r)! I'll do my best to help if I am able to! Please note that versions prior to 1.21 are not supported.
